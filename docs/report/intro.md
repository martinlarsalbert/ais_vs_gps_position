# Introduction
The Automatic Identification System (AIS) tracks the positions of ships. AIS transmits the ship's position measured by the Global Positioning System (GPS). Historical AIS data can be used to analyze the ship's operation. In this project, the traveled distance during a certain period should be measured with AIS, to be compared with measured fuel consumption (taken from another data source) to assess the ship's fuel economy. The ability to measure the distance with AIS is investigated in this report, as a prestudy to a later AIS analysis of fuel economy. The position of the ship is updated much less frequently than what the GPS is capable of. This means that the AIS will give a more coarse represenation of the ships trajectory, especially when either the speed or course of the ship is changing. The distance measured with the coarser AIS data is compared in this report, to the same distance measured with the finer GPS data which has been recorded onboard the ship.

# Summary
The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. A subset of points recorded by the GPS are transmitted from the ship with AIS. The AIS data contains fewer of these recorded points, which means that the total distance of lines connecting the AIS points will be shorter than the total distance connecting the original GPS points. The distances from AIS and GPS have been compared in this report for two ships. Distance calculated from the coarser AIS data was found to be 1-2% shorter than the corresponding measurement with GPS data. This means that key figures for fuel economy such as fuel consumption per nautical mile will be overpredicted up to 2% if AIS data is used.
